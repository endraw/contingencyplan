# pin. Overall Objectives: Remember in the end we want to make it a website that is also viewable (capable through android studio) ... along with full abillity to create/amalgamate My github.io website with My frontend site & logo, on any cellphone screen (ie. like a web portal on everything including iphones and androids and auto-adjust with all screen sizes)<a/>


# Objectives: 1. Rename My site<a/>

# things to type: 1. ensure my correct IIBA Certification is displayed with 2. a fakie sig ... of Not My Name (but yet my initials), somewhere at the end of the website credentials, this is to ensure against forgary and/or fraud. (see subnote)<a/>
# (cut and subnote this) On My own website; the fake signature is permitted (by me) and works by creating a "trace-note" -coined trace like way to well as an eg: a .png signiture file [with watermark] image/design makes it capable to trace theft of artistic-digital property).<a/>
# Ensure EVERY file including Copyrights/Trademarks/and full Rights Reserved icon, for logo, pictures, backgrounds, boarder designs, banners, titlebars/ribbons, frames and etc, etc ... (subnote All picture files are to have trace-note-like "watermarks" randomly across them, is to be included, (possibly use filetypes .svg or .png ... for now.<a/>
